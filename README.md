# LinkedIn Auto Connect Tool

Sometimes you want more `LinkedIn` connections, specially `500+`. This tool is very helpful on this.
Just run it from your favorite console or command promt and keep it running until you make enough connection requests.

> An automation tool to automate the connection requests in LinkedIn.

## Installation

Install this tool using `npm`:

```bash
$ npm install -g linkedin-auto-connect
```

It installs two binaries: `linkedin-auto-connect` and `lac` to your system path.

**Note**: It requires `node` and `npm` already installed. Install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if not already installed in your system.

## Usage

Use it as follows using `lac` command:

```bash
$ lac -u <enter_your_linkedin_email>
Enter LinkedIn password: *****
```

**Note**: It does not share your `LinkedIn` credentials, so it is safe to use.
